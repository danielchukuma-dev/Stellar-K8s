//! Storage auto-resizing for Stellar nodes.
//!
//! Split into two concerns:
//!
//! - [`metrics`] — reading kubelet volume usage. Kept separate from the HTTP
//!   call so the PromQL and response parsing are testable in isolation.
//! - [`autoresize`] — reflecting the resulting PVC size back onto the parent
//!   `StellarNode`, so the CR reports the capacity it actually has.
//!
//! The decision to *grow* a volume lives in
//! [`crate::controller::volume_resizer`], which is driven by
//! [`crate::controller::pvc_autoscaler`]. This module handles what happens
//! afterwards.
